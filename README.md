# Tech Demo of OPEN API by Swagger

![OPEN_API logo]()

## Introduction

Welcome to the Penguin's tech demo! Today we will be walking you through how to set up and use Open API, an API schema planner, generator, and testing toolkit that can be used to create better API backends for your websites.

## Why Use Open API

OpenAPI streamlines web development for HTTP-based API designers by standardizing API descriptions, allowing frontend teams to integrate seamlessly with backend services through clear, auto-generated documentation. For instance, tools like Swagger UI enable developers to visualize and interact with the API directly, speeding up the testing and iteration of interactive website components. Code generation also facilitates quick adjustments to website functionality. 


### Task 0: Create an account with Swagger

![Sign up](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/)

### Task 1: Setting up open api in Swagger editor

_please note that all credit and attribution for setup process belongs to [SwaggerIO]()._

We are going to use the online version of swagger editor for this process. For more detailed and dedicated projects, they recommend using the full desktop client.

First, go to the website to use the [online swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?_gl=1*1kmbfui*_gcl_au*MjA0NDYzNDQ1Ni4xNzEzMzE4MTAx&_ga=2.72475856.2107357273.1713318092-276513053.1713201288)
This page will show an editable document containing API configuration information. You can import a file to edit or work on the predefined template shown.

From here, anything you edit will change the results on the right-hand side of the page, which shows the specifications of your new API.

If you would like to use the same schema document we used, you can download this repository through the following git command:
```bash
git clone repo
```



### Task 2: Creating a React app to work with your Open API

to start using this API schema, we must create a react app that will act as our front end for the API.
INSERT REACT APP TUTORIAL

### Task 3: Creating azure project to work with Open API

We must also create a backend framework for this API.
INERT AZURE MINI TUTORIAL

### Task 3: Edit Your OPEN API configuration

Walk through creation here of documentation and schemas and stuff

### Task 4: Generate code for your Azure backend HTTP requests.

With Open API, you can generate templates for your API within your code database once you specify your endpoints and descriptions within your schema file.

### Task 5: Generate Open API components in react

You can also generate components for API calls within react automatically.

### Task 6: Test out your API!

With your API set up and configured, you can now test these endpoints using Swagger editor. 
Go back to your page that you created your schema. On the right hand side, you should see your specified endpoints and requests. Make sure to specify the correct server in the dropdown.

Next, Click on the API request you want to test out. Click on "Try it out." You can then fill in the request body and queries as necessary and click "Execute" when you're ready to test your request out. This will show you the response.

## Review and Discussion

To conclude, There are a lot of things to be absorbed that are described here in this end paragraph. If you've made it this far then you probably can submit your feedback! hope you enjoyed
